    <div class = "story">As you go up the stairs, you see two rooms. You look into the left one and see a classic half bathroom, toilet and sink. You look into the other and see a classic EARTHS CORE. Surprisingly the temperature is cold and appears very safe to venture in. You want to go to either the bathroom or the CORE. Which do you choose?</div>
